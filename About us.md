Hi! I'm a guy who likes to make Scratch projects! I like cats and dogs. In the past, I had 4 kittens, now I have a dog called **Bella**. I like Border Collie dog breed and Beagle dog breed. My dream is having a Border Collie dog, but I like my dog Bella too :) I help with the Scratch Nitro extension, and also I help with this page :) My favorite color is Green, and I designed a logo for the extension, but I think that Marc92020 have made a better logo :)
